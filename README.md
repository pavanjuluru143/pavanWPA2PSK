Aim 
---------------------------------------------------
The main aim of this research is to investigate vulnerability in WPA2-PSK password authentication scheme and enhance password attack technique by increasing probability of correct password, mitigation and design secure Wireless LAN.


Executing steps
---------------------------------------------------
STEP-1: Capture Handshake
STEP-2: Upload and convert a WPA / WPA2 pcap capture file to a hashcat capture file
STEP-3: Use password intelligence using OSINT Framework
STEP-4: Perform attacks on handshake file
STEP-4: Design Smart Home Network using Cisco Packet Tracer using WPA2-Enterprise  (802.11x authentication)

Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------
Research further successfully enhanced the password cracking process using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) framework, GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) and HashCat tools through reducing the number of passwords compared during attacks. Investigation use Hashcat tool to perform Hybrid attack, combinatory attack, and dictionary attack on handshake file. 
Different attack mode, masking, and rule used to perform actual password attack. 
It is efficient to perform attack for known password patters.
